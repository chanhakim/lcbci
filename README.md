## Introduction

Brain-computer interfaces are an emerging consumer product in the tech industry. Startups like Neuralink, Neurable, and Emotiv seek to  The goal of this independent project is to build a relatively low-cost brain-computer interface (<$200) using an Arduino microcontroller and C/C++ programming.



## Background

### Basic Neuroscience

### Basic Circuits

- The circuit is made of various electronic parts, consisting of resistors, capacitors, operational and instrument amplifiers.

### Basic Software



## Approach

### Schedule

- Week 1: Learning the basics of neuroscience, BCI, and neural signals.
- Week 2: Learning C/C++ syntax and setting up Arduino coding environment.
- Week 3: Learning the basics of circuits and building BCI circuit.
- Week 4: Building the real-time signal plotting software.
- Week 5: Finishing the real-time signal plotting software and testing the BCI circuit and signal acquisition software.

### Existing BCI Projects

I referenced following EEG projects to build the circuit:

- 

I followed the schematic.

### Components/Bill of Materials

- BCI Circuit

### Building the circuit

### Building the software

first built prototype in python tkinter

then built a prototype in pyqt5

then found an open-source real-time plotter in pyqt5



## Results

### The Circuit

[image of design] -> [image of actual circuit]

### The Software



## Discussion



## Next Steps

1. Refine understanding of circuit basics and learn more advanced circuit topics.

2. Data Collection

3. Neural Signal Analysis

4. Machine Learning

   A third direction to take this project is to
