# Minimal Brain-Computer Interface (RAISE 2020 Project)



## Abstract

With the recent progress of startups like Neuralink and Neurable, brain-computer interfaces are emerging as 'the next big thing' in the consumer tech market. A brain-computer interface or BCI is a device that can read and interpret neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). BCIs are interdisciplinary, combining neuroscience, circuits, signal processing and machine learning, and their immense complexity often requires a team of experts to create a novel system. This project aimed to understand basic neuroscience and circuit concepts and resulted in creating an arduino-based BCI and a real-time signal plotting program (mBCI Lab). Specifically, an Arduino Duemila and an EEG circuit design from an existing BCI project were used to create the BCI circuit, and the real-time signal plotting program was based upon a Python-based, real-time graphing project by SepÃºlvelda et al. in 2014. In the future, I will delve into more advanced neuroscience and circuits topics--to further deepen my understanding of BCI technology--and learn how to apply machine learning techniques to interpreting neural signals.
