# lcbci - low-cost brain-computer interface

## Introduction
The goal of this independent project is to build a low-cost brain-computer interface (<$200) using an Arduino microcontroller and C/C++ programming.

## Schedule
- Week 1 (2020/06/01): learning basic neuroscience/eeg/neural signal processing/electronics and purchasing components
- Week 2 (2020/06/08): basic C/C++, setting up coding environment, etc
- Week 3 (2020/06/15): building eeg and testing
- Week 4 (2020/06/22): collecting data/cross-examining existing papers
- ...

## Weekly Reports
- links will be added at the end of each week (updated every Sat/Sun)

## Acknowledgements
This project is made possible by Pomona College's RAISE program. I would also like to thank Professor Osborn (Pomona College Computer Science) for his mentorship.
